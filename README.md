### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- TurboPuffer API key ([Get one here](https://turbopuffer.com))
- OpenAI API key for embeddings

### Installation

1. **Configure environment variables**:
   Update `.env.local` with your API keys:
   ```
   TURBOPUFFER_API_KEY=your_turbopuffer_api_key_here
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Ingest sample data**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/ingestData.js
   ```

5. **Open your browser**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## üîç Demo Search Queries
